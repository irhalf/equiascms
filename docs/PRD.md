# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Naujan Lake Eco-Tourism & Wildlife Information Management System

- **Project Name:** Naujan Lake Eco-Tourism & Wildlife Information Management System (Visitor Hub)
- **Target Location:** Naujan Lake National Park (Ramsar Site No. 1008), Oriental Mindoro, Philippines
- **Document Version:** 1.0.0
- **Status:** Approved / Ready for Implementation
- **Author:** Troy R. Pajarito
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage)

---

## 1. Executive Summary & Problem Statement

### 1.1 Context
Naujan Lake is the fifth largest lake in the Philippines, a proclaimed National Park, and a designated **Ramsar Wetland of International Importance**. It is a vital sanctuary for thousands of migratory waterbirds, rare waterfowl, and endemic freshwater aquatic species. 

### 1.2 The Problem
1. **Scattered & Outdated Information:** Information on biodiversity, tourist boat tours, visiting rates, and lake access points is fragmented across outdated social media posts and static pages.
2. **Lack of Structured Biodiversity Education:** Visitors and students have limited access to verified ecological data (IUCN conservation status, habitat information, seasonal migration schedules).
3. **Unregulated Tourism & Safety Concerns:** Absence of a centralized, accessible digital repository for park guidelines, lake zoning policies, safety protocols, and waste management rules increases ecological degradation risks.
4. **No Centralized Advisory or Notification Channel:** When severe weather, water level changes, or bird migration peaks occur, park authorities lack a direct notification mechanism for visitors and researchers.
5. **Technical Bottlenecks in Content Management:** Previous promotion efforts relied on manual updates or static code manipulation, preventing non-technical park rangers and municipal tourism staff from updating records easily.

### 1.3 The Solution
A unified, responsive **Information Management System and Visitor Hub** providing:
- A public-facing portal for wildlife discovery, eco-tourism packages, conservation guidelines, and real-time park advisories.
- A newsletter and membership system for visitor alerts and researcher access.
- A secure, role-based **Administrative Content Management System (CMS)** enabling authorized park staff to manage wildlife records, tour packages, advisories, and booking inquiries without writing code.

## 2. Product Vision, Goals & Success Metrics (KPIs)

### 2.1 Product Vision
To establish the definitive digital hub for Naujan Lake National Park that balances sustainable eco-tourism promotion with active wildlife conservation education and modern visitor engagement.

### 2.2 Core Product Goals
- **Promote Sustainable Eco-Tourism:** Highlight accredited local boat operators, eco-tourism packages, birdwatching viewpoints, and cultural heritage.
- **Educate on Biodiversity:** Provide an interactive, structured wildlife catalog featuring endemic and migratory species with conservation classifications.
- **Enhance Visitor Safety & Compliance:** Ensure all visitors have immediate access to lake rules, zoning regulations, and emergency contacts.
- **Empower Park Administrators:** Deliver an intuitive backoffice CMS for rapid publication of advisories, articles, and inventory of eco-tourism packages.

### 2.3 Key Success Metrics (KPIs)
| Metric Category | KPI Target |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Performance** | Core Web Vitals: LCP < 2.0s, CLS < 0.1, FID/INP < 100ms on 4G mobile networks |
| **Accessibility** | 100% compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA contrast and keyboard accessibility |
| **SEO & Discoverability** | 90+ Lighthouse SEO score; structured metadata for all wildlife species and tour packages |
| **Content Efficiency** | Admin can publish a critical park advisory or new wildlife entry in under 3 minutes |
| **Mobile Responsiveness** | Flawless rendering on mobile viewports (375px+ to 4K desktop) |

## 3. Target User Personas & User Journeys

### 3.1 Persona Profiles

#### Persona A: Eco-Tourist / Casual Visitor ("The Explorer")
- **Profile:** Domestic or international traveler planning a trip to Oriental Mindoro.
- **Needs:** View curated tour packages, boat hire fees, birdwatching seasons, directions, safety guidelines, and send booking inquiries.
- **Pain Points:** Hard to find official rates; uncertain about lake rules and current weather/water conditions.

#### Persona B: Student / Academic Researcher ("The Biologist")
- **Profile:** University researcher, high school student, or conservationist studying wetland ecology.
- **Needs:** Searchable biodiversity catalog, scientific taxonomy, IUCN/DENR conservation status, species descriptions, and high-resolution media.
- **Pain Points:** Lack of organized local databases; inconsistent taxonomy on informal websites.

#### Persona C: Park Administrator / Ranger / Tourism Officer ("The Custodian")
- **Profile:** DENR-PENRO / LGU Tourism staff or Bantay Lawa member managing Naujan Lake National Park.
- **Needs:** Easy backoffice dashboard to post urgent advisories, add newly cataloged wildlife, update tour tariffs, review inquiries, and broadcast newsletters.
- **Pain Points:** Inability to update websites without hiring a developer; difficulty reaching registered visitors quickly.

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

### 8.1 Performance & Scalability
- **Page Load Speed:** Server-Side Rendered (SSR) / Static Site Generation (SSG) with ISR for catalog pages. Sub-2s First Contentful Paint.
- **Image Optimization:** Automatic WebP delivery with Next.js `<Image>` component, responsive sizes, and lazy loading below the fold.

### 8.2 SEO & Social Discoverability
- Dynamic OpenGraph (OG) image generation and structured JSON-LD schemas (`TouristAttraction`, `Article`, `Species`).
- Human-readable canonical URLs and auto-generated XML sitemaps.

### 8.3 Accessibility & Design Excellence
- Adherence to WCAG 2.1 AA: Minimum 4.5:1 text contrast ratio for normal body copy and 3:1 for large headers.
- Full keyboard navigation (Tab index, visible focus rings, ARIA labels on all interactive icons).
- Nature-inspired color palette (Emerald green, lake blue, clean slate, amber accents) utilizing the project's `ui-ux-pro-max` guidelines. Zero amateur emoji icons; strictly professional Lucide SVG icons.

### 8.4 Security & Data Privacy
- Supabase Row-Level Security (RLS) policies enforcing that only authenticated administrators can mutate data.
- Input sanitization on all inquiry and subscription forms to prevent XSS and SQL injection.

---

## 9. Scope Boundaries: In-Scope vs. Explicitly Out-of-Scope

### 9.1 In-Scope
- Centralized public web portal (Wildlife directory, tour packages, park rules, advisories, search).
- Visitor tour booking inquiry workflow with reference tracking.
- Email newsletter subscription engine.
- Role-based Admin CMS backoffice for content and inquiry management.
- Responsive design across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

### 9.2 Explicitly Out-of-Scope
- **Physical IoT Sensor Hardware:** Real-time lake depth sensors, automated water salinity telemetry, or animal satellite collars.
- **Direct Online Payment Gateway Integration:** E-commerce credit card / GCash merchant checkouts (the system uses booking inquiry with on-site payment at park headquarters to comply with local LGU/DENR treasury regulations).
- **Emergency 911 Dispatching:** System provides emergency contact numbers but does not replace municipal 911 or Coast Guard rescue dispatch services.
- **Academic Thesis Overhead:** Student grading rubrics, statistical sampling formulas, and Likert scale matrices are strictly excluded from the production software.

---
